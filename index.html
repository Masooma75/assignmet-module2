    1 teaspoon soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon cornstarch and let it sit and marinate for an hour.
    The beef should still be quite moist after it has marinated. If it looks too dry,
     add a tablespoon of water to it.
     Next, dredge the marinated beef slices in the remaining 1/4 cup of cornstarch until lightly coated.
   These steps ensure that the Mongolian Beef is tasty and crispy!
